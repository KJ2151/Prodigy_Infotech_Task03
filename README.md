# Task 03 – Predicting Term‑Deposit Subscriptions with a Decision Tree

Build a decision‑tree classifier that predicts whether a client will subscribe (`y`) to a term deposit after a tele‑marketing campaign.

## 📂 Dataset  
**UCI Machine Learning Repository – Bank Marketing Data Set**  
Link: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bank+Marketing  
Size: 45,211 rows × 17 inputs + 1 target.

## 🎯 Objectives  
* Pre‑process categorical variables (`job`, `marital`, `education`, …).  
* Train/test split with stratification.  
* Hyper‑parameter tuning (max depth, min samples leaf).  
* Evaluate using accuracy, precision‑recall, F1, ROC‑AUC.  
* Plot the learned tree & feature importances.
